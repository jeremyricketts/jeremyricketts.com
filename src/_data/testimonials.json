After the first session Jeremy gave us great advice in what to practice and within the first couple weeks we saw a huge change in Dutton. We are now able to walk him anywhere without having to dread being pulled around. We continue to see Jeremy for training as we move into basic command training! ❤️"

Jeremy always has the answers to all my tiny frustrations and makes it so Meryl and I can just focus on being best friends. We wouldn't be as happy as we are today without his help and I can't recommend him enough."
