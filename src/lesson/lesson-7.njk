      In this lesson we're finally introducing the concept of active corrections. We'll practice our skills from previous lessons to keep it light and fun. But we'll also set up scenarios that let us teach these critical and potentially life-saving skills.

  <h3>Can't I just say "NO?"</h3>
  <p>You could, but we recommend against it. "No" is a word most people use emotionally and inconsistently. Your dog doesn't understand the concept of "no" - they just hear a loud, sometimes scary sound. Instead, we teach specific commands ("off" and "leave it") that tell your dog exactly what we want them to do. It's clearer for them and more effective for you.</p>
</div>

<div class="exercise-section">
  <h3>Exercise: Teaching "Off"</h3>

  <p>The "off" command means "remove your paws from that surface." We use it for jumping on people, furniture, or anywhere else they shouldn't be.</p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Wait for your dog</strong> to jump on something (couch, you, etc.).</li>
    <li><strong>Say "off"</strong> in a firm but calm voice.</li>
    <li><strong>Guide them off</strong> with gentle leash pressure if needed.</li>
    <li><strong>Mark and reward</strong> the instant all four paws hit the ground.</li>
    <li><strong>Repeat</strong> consistently every single time they jump up.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The key is catching them in the act and being 100% consistent. Every single time = a command. Sometimes = just confusing them.</p>
</div>

<div class="tips-box">
  <h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>☝️ Don't push them off physically. Use your voice and leash pressure to guide them.</li>
    <li>☝️ Reward heavily for getting off quickly. Make compliance more rewarding than the jumping.</li>
    <li>☝️ Practice with furniture first, then progress to jumping on people.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="exercise-section">
  <h3>Exercise: Teaching "Leave It"</h3>

  <p>"Leave it" means "don't touch that thing" - it could be food, a toy, another dog's poop, or anything else you don't want them to interact with.</p>

  <div class="lesson-content-image lesson-content-image-right">
    <img src="/img/lessons/lesson-7/leave-it-dog.jpg" alt="Dog practicing leave-it with treats on the ground" loading="lazy">
  </div>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Place a treat</strong> on the ground and cover it with your hand.</li>
    <li><strong>Let your dog sniff</strong> and paw at your hand - that's fine.</li>
    <li><strong>Wait</strong> for them to back off or look away (even for a second).</li>
    <li><strong>Mark "yes!"</strong> and reward with a DIFFERENT treat from your pocket.</li>
    <li><strong>Repeat</strong> until they're backing off immediately.</li>
  </ol>

  <p style="clear: both;">Then progress to: hand partially covering the treat → hand hovering above it → no hand at all.</p>
</div>

<div class="tips-box">
  <h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>☝️ The reward MUST come from you, not from taking the forbidden object.</li>
    <li>☝️ Start easy and build difficulty gradually. Don't skip steps!</li>
    <li>☝️ Practice with progressively more tempting items: kibble → cheese → bacon.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="exercise-section">
  <h3>Exercise: Real-World Applications</h3>

  <p>Once they understand the basics, practice in realistic scenarios:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Drop a treat while walking and say "leave it"</li>
    <li>Practice near (but not too close to) interesting things at the park</li>
    <li>Have family members hold treats and practice "leave it"</li>
    <li>Progress to dropped food at the dinner table</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Build up slowly! A solid "leave it" can prevent your dog from eating something toxic or dangerous.</p>

    <h2>Homework</h2>
    <p class="text-xl mb-4">10-15 MINUTES &bull; 2-3 TIMES A DAY</p>

    <p class="mb-4">Practice both "off" and "leave it" daily. These commands need lots of repetition to become reliable, especially in distracting environments.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">Set up training scenarios - don't just wait for them to happen naturally. Drop treats on purpose. Put tempting things in their path during walks.</p>

    <p>Remember: these commands could save your dog's life someday. Invest the time to make them solid.</p>

    <h2>The Bigger Picture</h2>
    <p class="text-sm uppercase tracking-wider text-gray-500 mb-6">WHY ARE WE DOING THIS?</p>

    <p class="mb-4">"Off" and "leave it" are safety commands. Whether it's jumping on a fragile elderly person, eating chocolate left on the counter, or sniffing something toxic at the park, these commands give you a way to interrupt potentially dangerous behaviors.</p>

    <p>They also teach impulse control. A dog who can leave a piece of cheese on the ground when you say so is a dog who's learning to control their impulses. This skill transfers to other areas - less reactivity to dogs, better door manners, more patience when waiting for meals.</p>
