      In this lesson we're introducing two new things: the leash and the raised platform. We'll use markers, rewards, and luring to teach them the language of the leash as we move around and on top of the platform.

  <h3>Exercise: Introducing Leash Pressure</h3>

  <p>The leash is a communication tool, not a steering wheel. Your dog needs to learn what different sensations on the leash mean.</p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Attach the leash</strong> to your dog's collar in a low-distraction area.</li>
    <li><strong>Apply gentle pressure</strong> to the side (not backward - that triggers opposition reflex).</li>
    <li><strong>Mark and reward</strong> the instant they move in the direction of pressure.</li>
    <li><strong>Practice</strong> all four directions: left, right, forward, and gently back.</li>
  </ol>

<div class="tips-box">
  <h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>☝️ Use very light pressure at first - just enough for them to feel it.</li>
    <li>☝️ Release pressure immediately when they comply.</li>
    <li>☝️ Don't drag them! We want them to choose to move with the pressure.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="exercise-section" style="clear: both;">
  <h3>Exercise: Platform Work</h3>

  <p>The raised platform becomes a home base - a place where your dog knows exactly what's expected of them.</p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Place the platform</strong> on the ground and let your dog investigate it.</li>
    <li><strong>Lure them onto it</strong> with a treat.</li>
    <li><strong>Mark and reward</strong> when all four paws are on the platform.</li>
    <li><strong>Add duration</strong> - wait 2-3 seconds before marking.</li>
    <li><strong>Add movement</strong> - walk around the platform while they stay on it.</li>
  </ol>
</div>

<div class="tips-box">
  <h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>☝️ If your dog is nervous about the platform, start by rewarding any interaction with it.</li>
    <li>☝️ Make the platform fun! It should be their favorite spot.</li>
    <li>☝️ Practice getting on and off from different angles.</li>
  </ul>

    <h2>Homework</h2>
    <p class="text-xl mb-4">10-15 MINUTES &bull; 2-3 TIMES A DAY</p>

    <p class="mb-4">Practice leash pressure exercises and platform work separately. These are two foundational skills that we'll combine in future lessons.</p>

    <p>Keep practicing skills from previous lessons! Heeling, eye contact, and marker conditioning should all be maintained.</p>

    <h2>The Bigger Picture</h2>
    <p class="text-sm uppercase tracking-wider text-gray-500 mb-6">WHY ARE WE DOING THIS?</p>

    <p class="mb-4">Teaching leash language without distractions is crucial. In the real world, there will be squirrels, other dogs, and exciting smells. If your dog doesn't understand the basic language of the leash first, they'll never be able to respond to it when it really matters.</p>

    <p>The platform gives us a training tool that travels with us. It's predictable, portable, and becomes a "reset button" when training gets challenging. It's also the foundation for the "place" command we'll teach next.</p>
