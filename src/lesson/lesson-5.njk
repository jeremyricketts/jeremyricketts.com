      In this lesson we teach your dog that when we ask them to "place" or "sit" or "down" then we <em>also</em> want them to stay. To teach these <em>sustained</em> behaviors we'll teach them a couple new markers and a release word: "free".
    </p>
    <p class="text-base mt-3">
      This lesson is a little methodical but don't let that turn you off. Just know that it's worth it. If a sustain stay is too intimidating, it's easier than it looks.

  <h3>Before we start the exercises...</h3>
  <p>There's a new problem to solve for all this stay and release based training: Up until now we've only been marking short, momentary behaviors like eye contact, getting onto the platform, or sitting. But now we need markers for <em>sustained</em> behaviors too. Here's how we break it down.</p>
</div>

<h2 class="learn-heading">Learn: Two New Markers 📚</h2>

<p>There's a new problem to solve for all this stay and release based training. Up until now all of our markers break up, as our current marker ("yes") is what's called a <strong>terminal marker</strong> and it ends the behavior.</p>

<p class="my-4"><span class="marker-green">Your "Terminal Marker":</span> Your current marker ("yes"). It means "You did it! 🎉 Get up." This is our standard marker we conditioned back in Lesson 1. The terminal marker basically finishes the job for the exercise.</p>

<p class="my-4"><span class="marker-yellow">Your "Continuation Marker":</span> A new marker. I recommend a tonally neutral "good." The marker means <strong>stay right there</strong>. This is our sustained behavior marker. It tells the dog you're on the right track, keep doing what you're doing.</p>

<div class="warning-box">
  <h3>⚠️ Your "Feedback Marker"</h3>
  <p>The feedback marker is <strong>optional</strong>. A verbal, tonally neutral correction. A quick "nope" or "uh-uh" that serves as corrective feedback. It communicates to the dog that what they're doing is not what we want. <strong>Do not use "no" as a correction marker</strong> because many people use it emotionally and will end up scaring or confusing their dog with its variable use. Don't worry, a well-timed correction marker is mild. Think of it like a buzzer on a gameshow.</p>

<h2 class="learn-heading">Learn: Marker Usage for a Momentary Behavior</h2>

<p>Most of the things we want our dogs to do are quick, momentary behaviors. For the most part there are two outcomes:</p>

<ul class="list-disc list-inside my-4 space-y-2">
  <li><strong>They do it</strong>: Mark with terminal marker ("yes"), reward.</li>
  <li><strong>They don't do it</strong>: Feedback marker ("nope"), try again. Remember, "nope" is totally optional. If you say "yes" for everything good, they will learn the game eventually.</li>
</ul>

<p>It's still as easy as we learned. The only difference is that we can now optionally use our feedback marker ("nope") to help guide them. Let me show you an example with "sit."</p>

<h2 class="learn-heading">Learn: Release Word ✨ "Free"</h2>

<p>When your dog is in a sustained behavior (like a stay), they need a clear signal that it's okay to get up and move. This is where the release word "free" comes in. When you say "free," your dog should feel like a kid on the last day of school. Freedom is the reward!</p>

<h2 class="learn-heading">Learn: Marker Usage and Release for a Sustained Behavior</h2>

<p>Most of the things we ask our dogs to do in sustained behavior. Here's how the 3 markers are used in tandem:</p>

<ol class="list-decimal list-inside my-4 space-y-2">
  <li>Give the command (e.g. "place")</li>
  <li>✅ <strong>Use continuation marker ("good")</strong> to tell them to stay and deliver a reward.</li>
  <li>Wait a few seconds to let them build up their patience.</li>
  <li>⚠️ If they break the stay, use the feedback marker ("nope"). Gently guide them back into the position.</li>
  <li>✅ Use the continuation marker ("good") and reward when they return to the right position.</li>
  <li>🎉 <strong>Release with "free"</strong> and celebrate!</li>
</ol>

<p class="my-4" style="clear: both;">When "Place" is first learned, it's a 5-10 second stay. 30 seconds is great. Don't get frustrated if your dog gets off. They're just learning. It's like learning patience. This is a marathon, not a sprint.</p>

<div class="exercise-section">
  <h3>Exercise: "Place" with the Implied Stay</h3>

  <p>Now that you've got the tool kit of markers, let's start building duration on "place." Use what you learned above about markers to guide them through longer and longer stays.</p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Send your dog</strong> to "place".</li>
    <li>If they're on the platform, use the continuation marker <strong>"good"</strong> and reward while they're still on it. This tells them to stay put.</li>
    <li>After 5-10 seconds, release with <strong>"free"</strong>.</li>
    <li>Gradually increase the time before releasing.</li>
  </ol>
</div>

<div class="tips-box">
  <h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>☝️ Build duration slowly. Going from 10 seconds to 60 seconds takes weeks, not days.</li>
    <li>☝️ If your dog breaks the stay repeatedly, you've increased duration too quickly.</li>
    <li>☝️ Mark and reward multiple times during longer stays.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="exercise-section">
  <h3>Exercise: "Sit" and "Down" with the Implied Stay</h3>

  <p>The exact same process applies to "sit" and "down." Each command implies "hold this position until I say free." Use your continuation marker to reward patience and your release word to end the exercise.</p>
</div>

<h2 class="learn-heading">Increasing the Difficulty</h2>

<p>Once your dog understands the implied stay for "place," it's time to start increasing the difficulty with the 3 Ds:</p>

<p class="my-3"><strong>Duration:</strong><br>Slowly increase how long they stay. If your dog breaks, that's just information. Your dog is at its limit in that particular environment. Track durations so you can see improvements. Try to increase 10 to 15 seconds. Then increase. "3 to 5 then 5 to 10, etc."</p>

<p class="my-3"><strong>Distraction:</strong><br>Once you're confident in the staying and in the timing, change the environment or something like ping something. Track durations so you can see improvements and trends over time.</p>

<p class="my-3"><strong>Distance:</strong><br>Get an "Implied Stay" for 15 seconds. Then 30 seconds. Then increase. "Place to Place 15. to Place 30."</p>

    <p class="text-xl mb-4">10-15 MINUTES &bull; 2-3 TIMES A DAY</p>

    <p class="mb-4">Practice duration, distance, and distraction separately at first. Don't try to make it hard in all three ways at once! If you're working on distance, keep duration short. If you're working on duration, stay close.</p>

    <p>Use "free" consistently in daily life. Never let your dog decide when they're done - YOU release them.</p>

    <h2>The Bigger Picture</h2>
    <p class="text-sm uppercase tracking-wider text-gray-500 mb-6">WHY ARE WE DOING THIS?</p>

    <p class="mb-4">Implied stay changes everything. Instead of saying "sit... sit... SIT... STAY," you simply say "sit" once and your dog knows to hold that position until released. This is how professional trainers work with their dogs.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">The release word is equally important. Dogs who are released from every command learn to wait for permission before acting. This builds impulse control and makes them easier to live with in every way.</p>
