<div class="lesson-intro">
  <p class="text-lg">
    In this lesson we teach your dog that when we ask them to "place" or "sit" or "down" then we <em>also</em> want them to stay. To teach these <em>sustained</em> behaviors we'll teach them a couple new markers and a release word: "free".
  </p>
</div>

<div class="exercise-section">
  <h3>Exercise: Introducing the Release Word</h3>

  <p>Your dog needs to learn that commands have a beginning AND an end. The release word tells them "you're done now, you can move."</p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Put your dog in "place"</strong> on their platform.</li>
    <li><strong>Wait 2-3 seconds</strong>, then say "free!" in an upbeat voice.</li>
    <li><strong>Encourage them off</strong> the platform with a pat on your leg.</li>
    <li><strong>Praise them</strong> when they get off (no treat - freedom is the reward).</li>
    <li><strong>Repeat</strong>, gradually increasing the duration before releasing.</li>
  </ol>
</div>

<div class="tips-box">
  <h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>☝️ Make "free" sound fun and exciting! It should be a happy word.</li>
    <li>☝️ If they get off before you release them, calmly put them back on.</li>
    <li>☝️ Start with very short durations (5 seconds) and build up gradually.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="exercise-section">
  <h3>Exercise: Building Duration</h3>

  <p>Now we'll systematically increase how long your dog stays in position.</p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Give the "place" command</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>Count silently</strong> to your target duration (start with 10 seconds).</li>
    <li><strong>Mark with "yes"</strong> partway through (at 5 seconds).</li>
    <li><strong>Deliver treat</strong> while they're still on the platform.</li>
    <li><strong>Continue counting</strong> to your target duration.</li>
    <li><strong>Release with "free"</strong>.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The key is marking and rewarding DURING the stay, not just at the end. This teaches them that staying put is what earns rewards.</p>
</div>

<div class="tips-box">
  <h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>☝️ Build duration slowly. Going from 10 seconds to 60 seconds takes weeks, not days.</li>
    <li>☝️ If your dog breaks the stay repeatedly, you've increased duration too quickly.</li>
    <li>☝️ Mark and reward multiple times during longer stays.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="exercise-section">
  <h3>Exercise: Adding Distance and Distraction</h3>

  <p>Once your dog can hold a 30-second stay with you standing right there, start adding challenges:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Take one step away, then return and reward</li>
    <li>Walk in a circle around the platform</li>
    <li>Turn your back to them</li>
    <li>Walk across the room</li>
    <li>Leave the room briefly (work up to this gradually!)</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="homework-section">
  <h2>Homework</h2>
  <p class="text-xl mb-4">10-15 MINUTES • 2-3 TIMES A DAY</p>

  <p class="mb-4">Practice duration, distance, and distraction separately at first. Don't try to make it hard in all three ways at once! If you're working on distance, keep duration short. If you're working on duration, stay close.</p>

  <p>Use "free" consistently in daily life. Never let your dog decide when they're done - YOU release them.</p>
</div>

<div class="bg-gray-100 p-8 rounded-lg my-8">
  <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-3" style="color: var(--color-primary-green)">The Bigger Picture</h2>
  <p class="text-sm uppercase tracking-wider text-gray-600 mb-6">WHY ARE WE DOING THIS?</p>

  <p class="mb-4">Implied stay changes everything. Instead of saying "sit... sit... SIT... STAY," you simply say "sit" once and your dog knows to hold that position until released. This is how professional trainers work with their dogs.</p>

  <p>The release word is equally important. Dogs who are released from every command learn to wait for permission before acting. This builds impulse control and makes them easier to live with in every way.</p>
