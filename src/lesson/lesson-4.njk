<div class="lesson-intro">
  <p class="text-lg">
    In this lesson we'll teach your dog how to get onto a raised platform on their own with the <em>place</em> command. We'll teach this new skill using the 3 phases of learning: Performing, Pairing, and Proofing.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="exercise-section">
  <h3>Phase 1: Performing</h3>

  <p>First, we need to get the behavior happening reliably. Your dog already knows how to get on the platform from Lesson 3, so now we're adding the verbal cue.</p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Stand a few feet</strong> from the platform with your dog.</li>
    <li><strong>Say "place"</strong> in a clear, neutral tone.</li>
    <li><strong>Lure or guide them</strong> onto the platform if needed.</li>
    <li><strong>Mark and reward</strong> when all four paws are on it.</li>
    <li><strong>Repeat</strong> until they start moving toward it when you say "place."</li>
  </ol>
</div>

<div class="tips-box">
  <h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>☝️ Say the command only once. Don't repeat it over and over.</li>
    <li>☝️ Be patient. It might take 10-20 repetitions before they make the connection.</li>
    <li>☝️ Gradually reduce how much you help them. Let them figure it out.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="exercise-section">
  <h3>Phase 2: Pairing</h3>

  <p>Now we strengthen the association between the word "place" and the action of getting on the platform.</p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Move the platform</strong> to different locations in your house.</li>
    <li><strong>Practice from different distances</strong> - 2 feet, 5 feet, 10 feet.</li>
    <li><strong>Add distractions</strong> gradually - TV on, family members walking by.</li>
    <li><strong>Vary your position</strong> - send them from your left, your right, from behind.</li>
  </ol>
</div>

<div class="tips-box">
  <h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>☝️ If they struggle, make it easier again. Success builds confidence.</li>
    <li>☝️ Use high-value treats for harder challenges.</li>
    <li>☝️ End each session on a success, even if you need to make it easier.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="exercise-section">
  <h3>Phase 3: Proofing</h3>

  <p>Time to test the command in more challenging situations.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Practice outside in the backyard</li>
    <li>Send them to "place" from across the room</li>
    <li>Have family members give the command</li>
    <li>Practice when there are mild distractions present</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The goal is for "place" to mean "get on that platform" no matter where you are, who's asking, or what else is going on.</p>

<div class="homework-section">
  <h2>Homework</h2>
  <p class="text-xl mb-4">10-15 MINUTES • 2-3 TIMES A DAY</p>

  <p class="mb-4">Work through all three phases, but don't rush. Most dogs need several days at each phase. It's better to build a solid foundation than to rush through and have a shaky command.</p>

  <p>Use "place" in real life! During dinner prep, when guests arrive, or anytime you need your dog to go to a specific spot.</p>
</div>

<div class="bg-gray-100 p-8 rounded-lg my-8">
  <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-3" style="color: var(--color-primary-green)">The Bigger Picture</h2>
  <p class="text-sm uppercase tracking-wider text-gray-600 mb-6">WHY ARE WE DOING THIS?</p>

  <p class="mb-4">The "place" command is one of the most useful commands you'll ever teach. It gives your dog a clear job ("go there and stay there"), which reduces anxiety and gives them purpose. A dog with a clear job is a calm, confident dog.</p>

  <p>Understanding the three phases of learning - Performing, Pairing, and Proofing - will help you teach any new skill. This framework works for "sit," "down," "stay," and everything else we'll learn together.</p>
