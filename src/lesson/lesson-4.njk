      In this lesson we'll teach your dog how to get onto a raised platform on their own with the <em>place</em> command. We'll teach this new skill using the 3 phases of learning: Performing, Pairing, and Proofing.

  <h3>Before we start: Why the "place" command?</h3>
  <p>This is one of the most useful commands you'll ever teach your dog. It's the "go to" and "sit and be respectful" for the busy, multi-tasking household. It's an amazing, multi-purpose behavior management tool even if:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Annoying the other dog? Place.</li>
    <li>Stealing food on the counter? Place.</li>
    <li>Jumping on grandma? Place.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="mt-3">Whenever things get chaotic, "place" is our go-to. It's also a fantastic tool to use when your dog is overstimulated or anxious. The platform gives them a clear job, a boundary, and a sense of security. This especially good for anxious dog owners too who want to be able to go to a spot and settle down for a bit.</p>
</div>

<h2 class="learn-heading">Phase 1: Perform the Action</h2>

<div class="exercise-section">
  <p>The first thing we're going to do is use a combination of luring, leash pressure, and markers to get our dog performing the action reliably.</p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Stand a few feet</strong> from the platform with your dog.</li>
    <li><strong>Lure or guide them</strong> onto the platform.</li>
    <li><strong>Mark and reward</strong> when all four paws are on it.</li>
    <li>Apply gentle leash pressure in the direction of the platform. At first just at stop or a lean, mark ("yes") and reward.</li>
    <li>Build up to a full step onto the platform with all 4 paws.</li>
    <li>Walk around in a quick circle, maybe throw them a little frisbee party to celebrate.</li>
    <li><strong>Repeat</strong> until they start moving toward it eagerly when you guide them.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>You may spend a few training sessions in this phase. That's great! A very common mistake is to rush into phase 2 too quickly. The more confident they are in performing the action, the stronger the association will be in phase 2.</p>
</div>

<div class="tips-box">
  <h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>☝️ Don't forget that you can use leash to provide some gentle guidance as shown in Lesson 3. If you can feel them pumping the brakes, try guiding them rather than luring.</li>
    <li>☝️ Be patient. It might take 10-20 repetitions before they make the connection.</li>
    <li>☝️ Gradually reduce how much you help them. Let them figure it out.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h2 class="learn-heading">Phase 2: Pair the Action</h2>

<div class="exercise-section">
  <p>When your dog is doing this action repeatably and with confidence, it's time to pair the action with a command. In this case we'll use the word "place". Let's go!</p>

  <ol>
    <li>While you and your dog are lining up to do this for the next repetition, say "place" and let them do it as they have been.</li>
    <li>You may be saying "place" for a while before they really get it. Don't get frustrated. Not all dogs have a back-to-back, a pretzel, anything in this one word to use as a sound. "place".</li>
    <li>At some point, you'll feel them perk up (maybe a tail cock on the platform when you say "place" even before you start guiding them). That's great! Start to let them do it on their own. If they don't do it within 2 seconds, just help them.</li>
  </ol>
</div>

<div class="tips-box">
  <h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>☝️ The biggest common mistake here is not being precise with your mark and reward delivery. Really make sure you're marking the millisecond they comply and rewarding quickly after.</li>
    <li>☝️ If they struggle, make it easier again. Success builds confidence.</li>
    <li>☝️ If you've been practicing the "Getting It On" exercise from Lesson 3 a lot, your dog is probably already hopping onto the platform when they see it. Great! This just means the association is really strong and they may quickly pair the action to the command.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h2 class="learn-heading">Phase 3: Proof the Action</h2>

<div class="exercise-section">
  <p>At this point your dog is now hopping onto the platform when they hear the words "Place." Now we're going to increase the difficulty just a tad to help them understand that "place" means the same thing in a million different contexts.</p>

  <h4 class="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Change your position</h4>
  <p class="mb-4">Before saying "Place," switch up your position. We're teaching your dog that wherever they hear this word it always means the same thing.</p>

  <h4 class="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Change your location</h4>
  <p class="mb-4">Dogs can have a difficult time generalizing a skill to different locations. When you feel like your dog is reliably getting on the command try moving the platform to a different room. Then try moving it outside.</p>

  <h4 class="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Increase the distance</h4>
  <p class="mb-4">See how far you can get while getting it. Try saying "place" from a little further away from the platform.</p>
</div>

<div class="lesson-diagram">

</div>

<div class="tips-box">
  <h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>☝️ Make sure to do the proofing phase of teaching a skill, it's mandatory to being up the difficulty after they've shown that they can do it in a controlled environment.</li>
    <li>☝️ Start with a few different contexts. After 1 session, mark something new. Just try not to rush past those 3 criteria too fast.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="info-box">
  <p>This is another lesson where the key is <strong>not to rush</strong>. You don't need to skip ahead here.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Phase 1: Perform the Action.</strong> Only when they love to do the action move past with confidence.</li>
    <li><strong>Phase 2: Pair the Action.</strong> Only when they go right onto the platform when you say "Place" can you move on to Phase 3.</li>
    <li><strong>Phase 3: Proof the Action.</strong> This takes the longest. Proof in as many different contexts as you can. Don't skip it and then go to next lesson.</li>
  </ul>

    <h2>Homework</h2>
    <p class="text-xl mb-4">10-15 MINUTES &bull; 2-3 TIMES A DAY</p>

    <p class="mb-4">Work through all three phases, but don't rush. Most dogs need several days at each phase. It's better to build a solid foundation than to rush through and have a shaky command.</p>

    <p>Use "place" in real life! During dinner prep, when guests arrive, or anytime you need your dog to go to a specific spot.</p>

    <h2>The Bigger Picture</h2>
    <p class="text-sm uppercase tracking-wider text-gray-500 mb-6">WHY ARE WE DOING THIS?</p>

    <p class="mb-4">The "place" command is one of the most useful commands you'll ever teach. It gives your dog a clear job ("go there and stay there"), which reduces anxiety and gives them purpose. A dog with a clear job is a calm, confident dog.</p>

    <p>Understanding the three phases of learning - Performing, Pairing, and Proofing - will help you teach any new skill. This framework works for "sit," "down," "stay," and everything else we'll learn together.</p>
