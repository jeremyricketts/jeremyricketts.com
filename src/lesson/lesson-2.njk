      This lesson is all about body position. We're teaching your dog that when they follow their nose and pull up to your side that good things happen. This sets the foundation for everything we'll do with leash work later.

  <h3>Exercise: Luring to Your Side</h3>

  <p>Start in a low-distraction environment like your living room or backyard. You'll use food to lure your dog into the heel position (at your left side with their shoulder roughly aligned with your leg).</p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Hold a treat</strong> at your dog's nose level.</li>
    <li><strong>Move the treat</strong> in an arc that brings them around to your left side.</li>
    <li><strong>Mark and reward</strong> when they reach the correct position.</li>
    <li><strong>Repeat</strong>, gradually increasing the distance they need to travel.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The goal is for your dog to understand that being at your left side is a valuable place to be. We're building positive associations with this position.</p>
</div>

<div class="tips-box">
  <h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>☝️ Keep the treat close to their nose at first. As they get better, you can hold it higher (at your hip level).</li>
    <li>☝️ Don't worry about perfection yet. We're just building the foundation.</li>
    <li>☝️ If your dog is jumping for the treat, you're holding it too high. Lower it back down.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="exercise-section">
  <h3>Exercise: Following Your Side</h3>

  <p>Now that your dog understands the heel position, let's add movement. We want them to follow along as you walk.</p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Get your dog</strong> into the heel position using the lure.</li>
    <li><strong>Take a few steps</strong> forward, keeping the treat at their nose.</li>
    <li><strong>Mark and reward</strong> after 3-5 steps of them staying with you.</li>
    <li><strong>Gradually increase</strong> the number of steps before marking.</li>
  </ol>
</div>

<div class="tips-box">
  <h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>☝️ Start with just 2-3 steps. This is harder for them than you think!</li>
    <li>☝️ Use an excited, encouraging voice to keep them engaged.</li>
    <li>☝️ Practice in short bursts - 30 seconds to 1 minute at a time.</li>
  </ul>

    <h2>Homework</h2>
    <p class="text-xl mb-4">10-15 MINUTES &bull; 2-3 TIMES A DAY</p>

    <p class="mb-4">Practice both exercises, focusing on building that positive association with the heel position. Remember to keep sessions short and fun. If your dog starts to lose interest, take a break and try again later.</p>

    <p>Continue marking eye contact from Lesson 1! Don't let that skill fade.</p>

    <h2>The Bigger Picture</h2>
    <p class="text-sm uppercase tracking-wider text-gray-500 mb-6">WHY ARE WE DOING THIS?</p>

    <p class="mb-4">The heel position is more than just a trick - it's a fundamental communication channel between you and your dog. When they're at your side, they're in a position to watch you, follow your lead, and stay safe from hazards you can see that they can't.</p>

    <p>By teaching this now with positive reinforcement and no leash pressure, we're setting up future success. Your dog will already love this position before we ever add the complexity of a leash and outdoor distractions.</p>
