    At this stage your dog understands the language of the leash and has learned that sticking by your side is rewarding. Now we'll transition from suggesting it to <em>requiring</em> it.

  <h3>Exercise: The Penalty Yard</h3>

  <p>This is the foundation of loose leash walking. When the leash goes tight, forward progress stops.</p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Start walking</strong> with your dog on leash in a low-distraction area.</li>
    <li><strong>The instant</strong> you feel tension on the leash, stop moving.</li>
    <li><strong>Stand still</strong> like a tree. Don't pull back, don't say anything.</li>
    <li><strong>Wait</strong> for your dog to look at you or move back toward you.</li>
    <li><strong>Mark and reward</strong>, then resume walking.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Your dog will learn: tight leash = no progress. Loose leash = we keep moving toward interesting things.</p>

  <h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>☝️ This takes patience. You might stop 50 times in the first five minutes. That's normal!</li>
    <li>☝️ Don't pull them back to you. Wait for them to choose to relieve the pressure.</li>
    <li>☝️ Pick a boring, familiar area for practice. Save the exciting park for later.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="exercise-section">
  <h3>Exercise: The 180° Turn</h3>

  <p>For dogs who are really determined pullers, stopping isn't enough. We need to make pulling actively unrewarding.</p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Start walking</strong> with your dog.</li>
    <li><strong>When the leash goes tight</strong>, immediately turn 180° and walk the other direction.</li>
    <li><strong>Don't announce it</strong> - just turn. Use gentle leash pressure to guide them.</li>
    <li><strong>Mark and reward</strong> when they catch up to your side.</li>
    <li><strong>Repeat</strong> as many times as necessary.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>This teaches: "If you pull, we go away from the thing you wanted to investigate."</p>
</div>

<div class="tips-box">
  <h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>☝️ Change directions frequently to keep your dog paying attention to you.</li>
    <li>☝️ Reward heavily when they're walking nicely at your side.</li>
    <li>☝️ Practice in your driveway or yard first before going to exciting locations.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

  <h3>Exercise: Building Distance</h3>

  <p>Now we extend how far you can walk with a loose leash before rewarding.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Start by rewarding every 10 steps of loose leash walking</li>
    <li>Gradually extend to 20 steps, then 30, then 50</li>
    <li>Mix it up - sometimes reward at 10 steps, sometimes at 40</li>
    <li>Always reward at corners and after distractions</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Homework</h2>
  <p class="text-xl mb-4">10-15 MINUTES • 2-3 TIMES A DAY</p>

  <p class="mb-4">Practice in progressively more distracting environments. Start in your driveway, move to a quiet street, then to a park at off-peak hours. Don't skip steps!</p>

  <p class="mb-4">Remember: every walk is a training session for the first few months. Don't practice bad habits by letting them pull "just this once."</p>

  <p>Be patient with yourself and your dog. Loose leash walking is one of the hardest skills to teach because it requires such consistency from YOU.</p>

  <p class="text-sm uppercase tracking-wider text-gray-600 mb-6">WHY ARE WE DOING THIS?</p>

  <p class="mb-4">Loose leash walking transforms your relationship with your dog. No more dreading walks or feeling embarrassed at the park. No more shoulder pain or rope burn on your hands.</p>

  <p>More importantly, a dog who walks politely on leash is a dog who's paying attention to you instead of being dragged around by every sight and smell. This attention and connection is the foundation for all advanced training.</p>
