      At this stage your dog understands the language of the leash and has learned that sticking by your side is rewarding. Now we'll transition from suggesting it to <em>requiring</em> it.

      At first, most of your dog's successes here depends on keeping the environment low-distraction. Don't rush this step. Start at home and slowly, slowly work outward.

<h2 class="learn-heading">Learn: Loose Leash Walking vs "Heel"</h2>

<p class="mb-4"><strong>Loose leash walking</strong> is not a "heel." A loose leash walking dog is walking at your side and the leash is in a relaxed J-shape but they have some freedom. They can sniff things, look around, and enjoy the walk. The key rule is: the leash can never go tight.</p>

<p class="mb-4">A <strong>heel</strong> is much more precise. The dog's shoulder is aligned with your leg and their attention is fully on you. We'll get to this in advanced training, but for now loose leash walking is the goal.</p>

<h2 class="learn-heading">Learn: The New Leash Rules</h2>

<div class="info-box">
  <h3>🐕 HEAR YE!<br>These are the new rules of the leash henceforth!!!</h3>
  <p>From this point forward, the leash has two modes. Either it's relaxed (good!) or it's tight (bad!). When the leash is relaxed, we keep moving. When the leash gets tight, we stop immediately and wait. The dog needs to understand that pulling = no progress.</p>
</div>

<div class="exercise-section">
  <h3>Exercise: Outside U-Turns</h3>

  <p>Start outside in a low-distraction area with your dog on leash.</p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Start walking</strong> with your dog on leash in a low-distraction area.</li>
    <li><strong>The instant</strong> you feel tension on the leash, stop moving.</li>
    <li><strong>Stand still</strong> like a tree. Don't pull back, don't say anything.</li>
    <li><strong>Wait</strong> for your dog to look at you or move back toward you.</li>
    <li><strong>Mark and reward</strong>, then resume walking.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Your dog will learn: tight leash = no progress. Loose leash = we keep moving toward interesting things.</p>

<div class="tips-box">
  <h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>☝️ This takes patience. You might stop 50 times in the first five minutes. That's normal!</li>
    <li>☝️ Don't pull them back to you. Wait for them to choose to relieve the pressure.</li>
    <li>☝️ Pick a boring, familiar area for practice. Save the exciting park for later.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="exercise-section">
  <h3>Exercise: Inside U-Turns</h3>

  <p>For dogs who are really determined pullers, stopping isn't enough. We need to make pulling actively unrewarding. Try practicing inside where the environment is less stimulating.</p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Start walking</strong> with your dog inside your home.</li>
    <li><strong>When the leash goes tight</strong>, immediately turn 180° and walk the other direction.</li>
    <li><strong>Don't announce it</strong> - just turn. Use gentle leash pressure to guide them.</li>
    <li><strong>Mark and reward</strong> when they catch up to your side.</li>
    <li><strong>Repeat</strong> as many times as necessary.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>This teaches: "If you pull, we go away from the thing you wanted to investigate."</p>
</div>

<div class="tips-box">
  <h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>☝️ Change directions frequently to keep your dog paying attention to you.</li>
    <li>☝️ Reward heavily when they're walking nicely at your side.</li>
    <li>☝️ Practice in your driveway or yard first before going to exciting locations.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="exercise-section">
  <h3>Exercise: Erratic/Unpredictable Walking</h3>

  <p>Now we extend how far you can walk with a loose leash before rewarding. Mix it up!</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Start by rewarding every 10 steps of loose leash walking</li>
    <li>Gradually extend to 20 steps, then 30, then 50</li>
    <li>Mix it up - sometimes reward at 10 steps, sometimes at 40</li>
    <li>Always reward at corners and after distractions</li>
  </ul>

<h2 class="learn-heading">Learn: Two-Mississippi Pop</h2>

<p>If you absolutely feel the need to correct, here's the tool for the job. It's called a <strong>Two-Mississippi Pop</strong>. The idea is that you give your dog 2 full seconds to comply before applying a quick, light pop on the leash. It's not a yank. It's a quick "hey, remember the rules?" moment.</p>

<p class="my-4">Use this sparingly and only once your dog truly understands the rules of the leash. If they don't understand the rules yet, a correction won't help - only more practice will.</p>

    <h2>Homework</h2>
    <p class="text-xl mb-4">10-15 MINUTES &bull; 2-3 TIMES A DAY</p>

    <p class="mb-4">Practice in progressively more distracting environments. Start in your driveway, move to a quiet street, then to a park at off-peak hours. Don't skip steps!</p>

    <p class="mb-4">Remember: every walk is a training session for the first few months. Don't practice bad habits by letting them pull "just this once."</p>

    <p>Be patient with yourself and your dog. Loose leash walking is one of the hardest skills to teach because it requires such consistency from YOU.</p>

    <p class="text-sm uppercase tracking-wider text-gray-500 mb-6">WHY ARE WE DOING THIS?</p>

    <p class="mb-4">Loose leash walking transforms your relationship with your dog. No more dreading walks or feeling embarrassed at the park. No more shoulder pain or rope burn on your hands.</p>

    <p>More importantly, a dog who walks politely on leash is a dog who's paying attention to you instead of being dragged around by every sight and smell. This attention and connection is the foundation for all advanced training.</p>
