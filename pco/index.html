			<h1>Jeff &amp; Aaron's Questions</h1>

			<p class="question">Name a couple technologies or frameworks that that excite you. Why? What experience do you have with them?</p>

			<div class="answer">
				<ul>
					<li><strong>SASS (&amp; Compass)</strong> - Much of my current job involves front end development. SASS made this work fun again. I won't go back to vanilla CSS. <em>I won't.</em></li>
					<li><strong><a href="http://smacss.com/" title="SMACSS">SMACSS</a></strong> - Snook is a genius. I worked on the redesign of <a href="http://www.mail.com/" title="Mail.com">Mail.com</a> which sees a <strong>lot</strong> of traffic. Everything had to be modular and efficient and these principles were key.</li>
					<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll" title="Jekyll">Jekyll</a></strong> - My first foray into ruby is Jekyll. I've been building small static sites on it for the past year now. If it doesn't need a CMS, I'm building everything in Jekyll from now on.</li>
					<li><strong>Rails</strong> - Just getting started with Rails. I've worked with Django before and with .NET's MVC framework, but Rails is the granddaddy of them all. I'm about half way into this epic <a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book" title="tutorial">tutorial</a> a few guys at Build Guild recommended.</li>
					<li><strong>jQuery</strong> - I can't believe I added this, but look&hellip; I started learning js during the framework wars. Remember MooTools? A year of my life was spent maintaining Toyota.com which was built with Prototype and Scriptaculous. People take jQuery for granted now. If I ever see John Resig in person, I'm buying him a beer.</li>
					<li><strong><a href="http://backbonejs.org/" title="Backbone.js">Backbone.js</a></strong> - I did design and front end work for a mobile web app with a former Planning Center employee <a href="http://scottmotte.com/" title="Scott Motte">Scott Motte</a>. What a great dude. It was my first exposure to Backbone and the project went well. I'd like to use it again.</li>
					<li><strong><a href="http://angularjs.org/" title="AngularJS">AngularJS</a></strong> - We use <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/" title="Knockout">Knockout</a> extensively at my day job. At first, I thought Angular was the same exact thing. About a month ago, <a href="http://joshuaanguloinc.com/" title="friend of mine">friend of mine</a> gave me a whirlwind tour of it and from what I see, it looks a lot more powerful. I haven't used it yet though.</li>

			<p class="question">What is your current favorite web app and why?</p>

			<div class="answer">
				<p>This answer probably changes every couple weeks, but recently I've been very impressed with <a href="http://forecast.io/" title="Forecast.io">Forecast.io</a> (of "Dark Sky" app fame.) Go take a look. More importantly, go take a look on your phone (install the app from the web) and watch how fast and smooth it is. Their <a href="http://blog.forecast.io/its-not-a-web-app-its-an-app-you-install-from-the-web/" title="blog post">blog post</a> on how it was made was a real eye opener for me. Also, check out Forecast's <a href="http://forecast.io/lines/" title="Lines">Lines</a>, <a href="http://blog.forecast.io/the-forecast-data-api/" title="API">API</a>, and <a href="http://darkskyapp.github.io/skycons/" title="Skycons">Skycons</a>.</p>
				<p>This web app is no where as complex or important as Github, Gmail, etc. I just love it when small teams set out to push the limits of a platform (in this case, the web) and then show us how they're doing it along the way. Especially when Mark Zuckerberg is out there <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/11/mark-zuckerberg-our-biggest-mistake-with-mobile-was-betting-too-much-on-html5/" title="blaming HTML5">blaming HTML5</a> for Facebook's falling share prices.</p>

			<p class="question">Please respond to this sample customer support email regarding Resources:<br><br>
				&ldquo;Hi support! I've been using Resources and it's been great so far, but I had some questions. I see that I can create events, rooms or resources, but I can also create folders on each of those pages. What would folders be used for? I also noticed in your last blog post on Room Setups, you posted some pictures of some room setups. Is there a Room Setup picture editor in the program, and if not can you add that? Thanks.&rdquo;</p>

			<div class="answer">
				<p>Hi there! First off, thank you for helping us beta test Planning Center Resources. We're trying very hard to make this product intuitive and useful when it launches in a few months. Your feedback and your questions are a big part of that and we genuinely appreciate it.</p>
				<p><strong>Folders</strong> - Some churches are managing a <em>lot</em> of events, rooms, and resources. Folders are an optional way of splitting these up so the list becomes more manageable. For example, a church that is expanding into a second building might organize their rooms into two folders: "East Building" and "West Building."</p>
				<p>Another advantage to folders is this: let's say you have a room called "Nursery" in both the East and the West buildings. Normally, the system won't allow you to have two rooms (or events or resources) with the exact same names. By putting rooms in different folders, you'll be able to have a "Nursery" in the "East Building" folder as well as a "Nursery" in the "West Building" folder.</p>
				<p><strong>Room Setup diagram editor</strong> - It's a great idea. We've talked about creating an in-product image editor for creating room diagrams. In the end, we decided to shelve the idea for now. As we learned with Planning Center Services, the core features have to work very well before we can start adding complex pieces (like a browser-based image editor.) Resources is a young product so there's a list of small but significant features we need to launch before tackling something like that.</p>
				<p>Remember, you can add any image file as a room diagram. Most people use a sharpie, some paper, and a scanner. However, we've seen some customers sketch the rooms out on a white board, snap a picture with their phone, and use the picture as the diagram. It's low tech but it's fast and simple!</p>
				<p>Thanks again for the question and the suggestion.<br>~ Jeremy at Planning Center Online</p>

			<h1>Product Manager Application</h1>

			<div class="callout answer">
				Regarding the Product Manager Application questions:

				<p>In looking at the current version of Resources, there already appears to be basic inventory management. When a resource is added to an account, a quantity for that resource is defined by the user. When resources are requested (and approved) the quantity of the resource goes down by the number approved. If the current quantity of a resource is zero, it can't be requested. This, to me, looks like "Stage One" inventory management in Resources.</p>

				<p><strong>After spending some time with Resources, I had some other ideas for potentially more unique features.</strong> Here are the three larger ones I've been thinking about:</p>

				<h4>1) More tightly coupling resources with rooms:</h4>

				<ul>
					<li>"What" you want to use is important but "where" you want to use it could also be relevant. I got to thinking about how this would look if resources were assigned to rooms. This would mean changing the event registration modal of course, so perhaps this is less of a new feature and more of a system tweak.</li>
					<li>This could open up a new area of exploration for Resources: knowing where resources are at any given moment, or where they were last checked out. Someone didn't put rolling TV unit #8 back in the storage room? Let's see where it was last used. You could even make a resource allocation map that shows you where everything is at a glance.</li>
					<li>What happens if someone needs a resource, but will not be using it in a specific room? This brings me to&hellip;</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h4>2) Off site events:</h4>

				<ul>
					<li>Not all church events take place at the church campus. Events like youth outings, outreaches, and community work may take place elsewhere. If resources will be used off site, requesters would still need to tell the approvers where the resources will be used.</li>
					<li>Maybe there are some resources you don't want to go off site. This brings me to&hellip;</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>3) Resource restrictions:</h4>

				<ul>
					<li>By default, a resource should be able to be used anywhere. However, there are some that shouldn't (or can't) be used in certain rooms or for off site events. Consider the following examples: 
						<ol>
							<li>A 12' tall plastic Christmas tree that only fits in 3 of the 10 rooms.</li>
							<li>An organ on wheels that can't be moved up stairs (first floor rooms only.)</li>
							<li>A hot coffee station that is not allowed in the nursery.</li>
							<li>A roller TV that's not allowed in the kitchen.</li>
							<li>A particularly expensive overhead projector that's not allowed off site.</li>
							<li>Speakers that shouldn't be used in the library.</li>
							<li>A room that is limited to 200 chairs due to fire codes.</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>My purpose in sharing these additional ideas is to show that I can think critically about a complex system and that I'm familiar with the resource management needs of a church.</p>

				<p>Okay. Back to the questions. &#9786;</p>

			</div>

			<p class="question">Please write us an example blog post describing your ideas for some new Inventory Management features we could integrate into Resources. Inventory Management could potentially be an entire application, but we're looking for "Stage One" of implementing inventory features into Resources, so don't get too ambitious. The blog post should be written as if the features are complete and you are explaining them to our customers.</p>

			<div class="answer">
				<h2>Planning Center Resources: Resource Shortages</h2>
				<p>Planning Center Resources is all about better communication between resource managers and the people that need those rooms and resources. Part of that is knowing when there's simply not enough of a resource to go around. Identifying shortages is now a little easier with the new "Report a shortage" tool.</p>
				<p>Here's how it works:</p>
				<p><img src="/img/pco/shortage1.jpg"> 1) If there are unavailable resources for the event you're setting up, you will 2) have the option of reporting a resource shortage.</p>
				<p><img src="/img/pco/shortage2.jpg"> 3) Select which resources you <em>would</em> have booked, had they been available.</p>

				<p><img src="/img/pco/shortage3.jpg"> 4) Submitting your shortage report will do two things: First, in the resource details, managers will be able to see how often the resource was reported short. Second, the shortage will be added to your event discussion.</p>

				<p>By submitting reporting shortages, resource managers will know when they need to procure another rolling TV stand, coffee cart, folding table, or any of the other things it takes to keep your church building, well&hellip; resourceful!</p>
			</div>

			<p class="question">Separate from the blog post, send us any extra developer/designer details that you would communicate to them as they are designing and developing your features. These would be any technical or design considerations that would probably be too much info to describe to users, but might be critical knowledge of the inner-workings. For instance, I might publicize in a blog "You can now duplicate event reservations. Just hover over an existing reservation and click the new duplicate button." I'd also have to tell my developers "When duplicating an event, reset all statuses to pending and ask the user to choose new dates for the duplicated event." I'd probably be more detailed than that, but you get the idea.</p>

			<div class="answer">
				<h3>Dev</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>A shortage report should tell the resource manager this: someone had an event and needed an X. They couldn't reserve an X because there wasn't enough inventory of that resource. The event day came and they didn't have an X (no X's opened up.)</li>
					<li>A shortage status on a resource should be an on/off status.</li>
					<li>Shortage reports are removed ("off") when the resource has been reserved for the event (there wasn't enough X, a shortage report was flagged, and then X became available and the event organizer added it before the start of the event.) This effectively nullifies the shortage report.</li>
					<li>For a shortage report to count as part of the resource shortage statistics it must active ("on") when the associated event starts.</li>
					<li>Validation: There does not need to be any "this item was already reported short for this event." messaging. There is no way to remove a shortage report other than 1) canceling/deleting the event before the starting time or 2) adding it to the event when inventory loosens up.</li>
					<li>For repeating events, do not count a shortage report on every repeated date. Only the initial one.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Design</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Design for this feature should be subtle. If all the resources and/or rooms are available for an event, don't even show the option.</li>
					<li>This feature (at least the reporting tool) will live in the Edit Event modal window. I'm guessing stacked modal windows is something we want to avoid, so we need to be clever about integrating it into the Edit Event modal itself.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Future scope expansion</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Alerting event schedulers when a resource previously reported short becomes available.</li>
					<li>"Alert me when one of these is available."</li>

					<li>A dashboard for approvers to see shortage reports across all resources (rather than having to go to the individual resource details pages.)</li>

			<p class="question">Send us some sort of graphical representation of the interface for your feature. This can be a picture of a drawing, simple wireframes, or anything at all that gives us a clear idea of how it would work. We don't expect anything near pixel-perfect images since this is not a design position, but your images would be an example of what you might then hand off to the designer who would create the actual artwork. Feel free to include these images in your blog post or send them separately.</p>

			<div class="answer">
				<p><img src="/img/pco/details.png" class="go-right width-60">The blog post shows the key screens for the user that is scheduling the event. The only thing I didn't mock up was a simple success message after the shortage report goes through.</p>
				<p>The other piece of this would be the "Resource Details" page. We'd need to convey how many events this resource has been short on. The design goals would be: 1) show at a glance how dire the situation is with this resource. Is it only one person who reports a shortage or are lots of users reporting the same shortage? 2) when the shortages occur along a timeline. Is it <em>always</em> in short supply or is it only on Easter Sunday?</p>

				<p>Included below are a few real examples of the types of project management work and product direction I've been doing at HireAHelper for the past 3 years.</p>

			<p class="question">Project: HireAHelper Company Wiki</p>

			<div class="answer">

				<p>The HireAHelper company wiki was an initiative of mine once our company grew to about 10 people. At this point, information was spread among many individuals, we constantly lost track of company information, and we were wasting time tracking things down.</p>

			<p class="question">Copy Writing.</p>

			<div class="answer">

				<p>I can write copy 'til the cows come home. Here are some examples:</p>

				<ul>
					<li><strong><a href="http://hireahelper.com" title="Homepage">Homepage</a></strong> - Short, punchy copy. (Unless you receive the "minimalist" test variation where there's essentially NO copy.)</li>
					<li><strong><a href="http://hireahelper.com/how-it-works/" title="How It Works">How It Works</a></strong> - Lots to communicate in as few words as possible.</li>
					<li><strong><a href="http://hireahelper.com/faq/" title="FAQ">FAQ</a></strong> - This page is 3,207 words of carefully crafted, legal-department-approved copy. Even if it's boring copy, I can write it.</li>

			<p class="question">Presentations</p>

			<div class="answer">

				<p class="clear"><a href="/img/pco/monthly-presentation.png" class="go-right width-60 modal-img"><img src="/img/pco/monthly-presentation.png"><span class="overlay"><i class="icon-search"></i></span></a><strong>Internal/team presentation:</strong><br>At HireAHelper I presented the current progress of the dev team every couple months. This was a higher level meeting to other department heads and sometimes investors.</p>

				<p class="clear"><a href="/img/pco/pitch.png" class="go-right width-60 modal-img"><img src="/img/pco/pitch.png"><span class="overlay"><i class="icon-search"></i></span></a><strong>External/partner presentations:</strong><br>As a young startup, we were constantly pitching VC's and potential partners. Here's a sample.</p>

			<p class="question">Project Kickoff Meetings</p>

			<div class="answer">

				<p class="clear"><a href="/img/pco/scope-1.png" class="go-right width-30 modal-img"><img src="/img/pco/scope-1.png"><span class="overlay"><i class="icon-search"></i></span></a>Kickoff meetings are when you first start talking about a project. What does this thing need to do? What are the major concerns? How does the thing need to <strong>generally</strong> work?<br><br>After that, we'd define all the user stories and then, finally, meet with the dev team to project the size of the project and get an idea of how long it could potentially take.</p>

				<p class="clear"><a href="/img/pco/project-management.png" class="go-right width-30 modal-img"><img src="/img/pco/project-management.png"><span class="overlay"><i class="icon-search"></i></span></a>Here is another example of a project management kickoff I prepared for. <br><br>In this example, I made some quick-and dirty mockups of how the UI might work.</p>

			<p class="question">Time-Projecting for Projects (defining requirements, scope, level-of-effort, etc)</p>

			<div class="answer">

				<p><a href="/img/pco/estimating.png" class="go-right width-60 modal-img"><img src="/img/pco/estimating.png"><span class="overlay"><i class="icon-search"></i></span></a>Even though our team tries to adhere to the "Agile" development process, we often needed to find a ball-park figure of how long the project would take. This meant splitting it out into its largest chunks, estimating a best/worst case scenario, and reporting back to the group. (You have to be very careful with doing this, if you're truly trying to be an "Agile" shop. It's hard.)</p>

			<p class="question">Bug Reporting</p>

			<div class="answer">

				<p><strong>Skill showcase:</strong> Taking ownership and making a quick-and-dirty solution when the need was great.</p>

				<p>At HireAHelper, I took on the ownership of how bugs were reported by our staff. I built a form in our admin panel which asked some questions and then posted directly into GitHub issues.</p>

				<p class="clear"><a href="/img/pco/bugsystem1.png" class="go-right width-30 modal-img"><img src="/img/pco/bugsystem1.png"><span class="overlay"><i class="icon-search"></i></span></a> <a href="/img/pco/bugsystem2.png" class="go-right width-30 modal-img"><img src="/img/pco/bugsystem2.png"><span class="overlay"><i class="icon-search"></i></span></a>Here's what the form looks like in our admin panel, and what it generates in github issues. It's worked pretty well!</p>

				<p class="clear"><a href="/img/pco/bug-report-2.png" class="go-right width-30 modal-img"><img src="/img/pco/bug-report-2.png"><span class="overlay"><i class="icon-search"></i></span></a> <a href="/img/pco/bug-report-1.png" class="go-right width-30 modal-img"><img src="/img/pco/bug-report-1.png"><span class="overlay"><i class="icon-search"></i></span></a>I like to go the extra mile for bug reporting. I almost always include a screenshot so people know exactly what I'm talking about.</p>

			</div>

			<p class="question">Business Metrics</p>

			<div class="answer">

				<p><a href="/img/pco/browsers.png" class="go-right width-30 modal-img"><img src="/img/pco/browsers.png"><span class="overlay"><i class="icon-search"></i></span></a>I try to keep a pulse on things.</p>

				<p>In this example, I set an alert in Google Analytics to tell me when our IE7 usage had dropped below a certain threshold. After all, there's no sense supporting a browser that takes 20% of our front-end-dev effort, but doesn't bring any revenue.</p>

				<p><strong>Skill showcase:</strong> Taking initiative to track something no one else was tracking, and then presenting my findings in a compelling way.</p>

			</div>

			<p class="question">Technical Design</p>

			<div class="answer">

				<p><a href="/img/pco/api.png" class="go-right width-30 modal-img"><img src="/img/pco/api.png"><span class="overlay"><i class="icon-search"></i></span></a>Because I come from a technical background, I can often help define a project in ways that developers understand.</p>

				<p>In this example, I know that it makes sense to think of RESTful api's in terms of their URL structure. By bringing this document to the initial kickoff meeting, we were able to jump into the API design immediately.</p>

			<p class="question">Sample Project Leadership: Customer Service Dashboards</p>

			<div class="answer">

				<p>Another example that showcases my ability to direct a project.</p>

				<p class="clear"><a href="/img/pco/pm2.png" class="go-right width-30 modal-img"><img src="/img/pco/pm2.png"><span class="overlay"><i class="icon-search"></i></span></a> <a href="/img/pco/pm3.png" class="go-right width-30 modal-img"><img src="/img/pco/pm3.png"><span class="overlay"><i class="icon-search"></i></span></a>I came to this meeting with some quick-and-dirty mockups for a customer service rep dashboard. As a team, we talked about what the dashboard should and shouldn't do.</p>

				<p class="clear"><a href="/img/pco/pm1.png" class="go-right width-30 modal-img"><img src="/img/pco/pm1.png"><span class="overlay"><i class="icon-search"></i></span></a>After thinking about the functionality and looking at some UI mockups, we had to do some negotiating among us. What features should be a part of a minimally viable product? What features can be bundled together for a v2 of the system?</p>
